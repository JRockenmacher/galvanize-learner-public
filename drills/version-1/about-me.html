        <section class="bio">
            <p>Growing up in Carlsbad, CA, believe it or not, I did not grow up surfing. I remember, even from a young age, being fascinated by and exploring how things work. As I grew up I collected hobbies such as BMX, working on cars, and dancing. I explored other hobbies, but a big stress for Califonians is the function of time, or lack there of, due to travel time and cost of living in CA. I remember having some friends in high school that were big into computers and I bet you can imagine I am kicking myself now for not having the ability to look ahead and see just how large the demand for computer and tech jobs would be now. High school was easy but difficult, being a white-male, but being the weird goth kid, that liked cars, and had unique views of the world, in a fairly superficial area, made me a little more conspicuous than I liked. However, the good of that was a development and commitment to being my own person, and a degree of self-acceptance and freedom that it brought. If I could dig up any jewels formed in my life, the formation of the commitment to self-integrity was certainly first, beginning here in school.</p>
            <p>Graduating high school I struck out on my own. I felt driven to do this as home life through my teens was less than ideal, and I see now, that I had to become who I was to become, without the influence of family; I had to experiment with life on my own. This brought me to a religious school in the Denver area. Though I dropped the religion, getting me here acted as the catalyst in becoming a Denver resident: I found that people took time to have friendly conversation and the pace of life wasn't as hectic (unlike today, of course). My 20's solidified the person I wanted to become, and refined my skills in community development, mechanics, STEM fields, and gave me a voracious appetite for the scientific method with a foul taste for misinformation and sloppy data. This pushed me deeper into mechanics and influenced my goal to obtain a BS in biology focusing on micro and botany. If you wonder why that vs an engineering degree, there are two answers to that: There still is plenty of time left in life, and I got a passion for aquaponics while attending Jr. college here. Though, I am proud of the person I have become, I found late in my 20's that the world is changing and I needed to evolve myself to adapt (just like in nature) but what career field could I get into that I could keep my personal integrity and ethics, and make enough for a relatively comfortable life and freedom to do the things I want in even a small capacity?</p>
            <p>Enter a few of my best friends I made in my late 20's. The scene has the cost of living and housing going up, the end of a long term relationship and being under-employed for months. I had to obtain a second job, along with my fulltime job, just to afford to survive. It was a good gig, where I accelerated my skills as a mechanic to new heights, building speed and efficiency along with improving the tactile craft of working on cars, and being able to better diagnose a vehicle. Both of these friends came to me, independent of each others' influence, stating that I should really look into this high-demand field of web-development. My friend, Mike (COO at AIS), was the influence that locked me onto the trajectory my life as a web-developer. I started playing with the free code tutorials and websites, and started to look at the myriad of bootcamps at Mike's advice. He recommended Galvanize, but provided the other ones he was familiar with so I could research. During the research I discovered there was a Learn To Code one Saturday at Galvanize's GT campus. The clarity of the info provided and the reviews of the various schools had me leaning towards Galvanize, and after seeing the caliber of teacher Galvanize had (James S. was the lead that day) my decision was final. In December, I began the process of admissions. From there came a whirlwind of activity preparing budgets, finances, etc. for the coming change. There is still logistics even now, I need to work out, but through sheer grit, the support of my friends and family and a little luck, I rose to every challenge that presented itself to me believing that I would overcome it just like the previous challenge. This acted as a great primer for G-School, as I have and will have harder and harder challenges as every week passes by. Now we are here at the present day, and I am growing, adapting and honing my skills and habits to set myself up for the most success here possible. I have developed a network of friends here eager to support and help with the challenges I run into. I aim to bring up those weak areas without the pride of needing to do it myself. Just like life, we are in this together, and often cooperation and collaboration will get much more done than what one person can do alone. In the sage words of a plastic space-man: "To infinity- And beyond!"</p>
