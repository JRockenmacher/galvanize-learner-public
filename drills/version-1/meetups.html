        <h2>A Taste Of The Folk I Met (not like Dahmer)!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Denver Rails Bridge: Coffee & Hack Session; Cafe Europa March 11, 2018</h3>
            <h4>People Met, Things Learned</h4>
                <p>Dana- Ruby freelance developer; makes code more readable and easier and faster to write. very economical for employers to get a working page done without paying them to write extensive code. Stated ROR can be "culty" among its developers and focuses on "convention over configuration". The way he made it sound is that ROR has it's place and can do many of the database heavy tasks and communication smoothly and efficiently, saving the developer time and the employer money. He also was using tig and kaleidoscope for version control</p>
                <p>Carl- PCI Compliance for data security with security pathways: computer talks to utility server, which interacts with production server and git hub, having firewalls and such in place to make it difficult to deploy anything and limits access in the quest for security, to the point where even computer access to utility server is limited: having rules such as pre-screening of the computer, certain restrictions to access and privacy, making it so to interact, the person interacting with the server is not only one of the limited few authorized to do so, but that person also has a dedicated machine to interact with the secured server with. The redundant protocols help deter attack or access by making it extremely difficult to access in the first place. If one wanted to hack into the servers, they would need a high degree of sophistication and a lot of time to jump through all the security protocols</p>
                <p>Jeanette- client side at Pivitol (uses React and typescript, django)... When I asked what are some major concepts she sees in the industry, her answer was as follows: Stability is big in the working world. Also, I was told in project direction and platforms, it's the engineers' choice based on the project manager's abstract, and the scope and size of team. As far as advice to me as I am early in my journey into becoming a better developer: a willingness to experiment helps, development of good practices. In order improve workplace relations and improve team moral, Pivotol does "pair-lunches" (think: pair-programing). This incentivizes empathy between co-workers and strengthens professional relationships, making all parties be more sensitive to the struggles with one another and makes confrontation easier when someone inevitably transgresses another. Though this is something Pivitol provides and incentivizes it, Jeanette recommends that it is a good practice, and to use the spirit in that to some form or another to assist in building better teams and working environments. As evidenced, her advice to me was to really dig into building soft skills practice while I'm early in my new career, to set a good prescedent for myself and build good practices. More advice to someone like me who gets excited and talks a lot was in dialog, practice active listening, and be open/ transparent about own failings and desire to improve. This will help me come across as less commanding and also invite to others to hold me accountable for my actions and help me improve myself beyond my character weaknesses. I also noticed some cool stickers on her laptop, one was a Octocat rendition of a developer she looked up to: Grace Hopper, whom always carried around a length of copper wire that represented the length of a second as travelled by electricity. She pioneered machine learning and is notable particularly for her work on a complier that converted code written in English to code a computer could understand. Her accomplishments gained her many awards, honorary degrees, and a Presidential Medal Of Freedom by President Obama. It was really cool learning about a new-interesting person in tech just from going to a meetup, and I was spurred to read more about her after. The other interesting sticker on Jeanette's machine was a Chaos Monkey one. Netflix uses this to test their system robustness by having it perform a variety of web attacks on their system in a simulated environment in many ways. This also let to the Simian Army, with different primates(programs) performing different tasks. As far as front end frameworks to look into: Google Polymer. I will read up on this more later.</p>
            <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why Ruby is used widely still when it's falling out of favor. Benefits of learning Ruby?</li>
                    <li>Bridge foundry => bridge troll org about getting under-represented folks into coding?</li>
                    <li>What can I do with Google Polymer?</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Learn To Code Denver: Social Session; Denver Public Library March 12, 2018</h3>
            <h4>People Met, Things Learned</h4>
                <p>Jessi is Word press developer in Northglenn; right now she is learning Laravel framework which acts as a scaffold for full stack development... building simple apps Model View Controller how front and back in are connected. Using tutorial at linda.com... Some benefits or using such framework are it's very powerful, build up apps fast with less keystrokes. Her advice to me in picking up new languages were to find a project and learn by doing. Follow along with a build along course. The agency she works for sends abstract problems (ie screen shot) and what is wanted and it is up to her to discern the client's needs and fix the bugs or style the page closest to the dictated needs. As far as her work flow, Rule One: inspect the page first! In inspector use console log to narrow down inspections and narrow down the target elements with the selector tool. Also, as far as advice for a Jr. developer like myself, it is best to WORK WITH PEOPLE!!! Solo is difficult, and usually takes longer when stuck, as one doesn't just have more senior developers whom they can pick the brain of.</p>
                <p>Alex (Organizer) Python is more mature than JS, and was built for effect. IDE integrated development (Intelli-J; Py-charm; Sublime); His firm has a hybrid of agile development for work-flow: Mon- reflect then planning goals, etc. Picking a bug, Tue-Wed ticket work, bugs, chores, feature; Thur check in and back log maintenance. They use Pivitol tracker for ticketing. Some benefits of the system is the analytics it has built in. One that stood out to me was: velocity = points gained per ticket, based on the difficulty of the ticket. His favorite language is Python but React is up there. When asked about comment protocol. He stated it is used as supplement to code written intuitively. No redundant comments. Pressure high to gets code out so realistically not a lot of comments unless the code is more complex and requires it. It kinda echoes the convention over configuration comment from the other day.</p>
                <p>Finally, I did learn to not be afraid of any language, but to also, focus on one that I can get really good at as it will help me develope good habits and assist in helping me learn the intricacies of other languages here in the future.</p>
            <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the best way to build fast competency with an IDE?</li>
                    <li>What are real world applications of choosing Python over JS?</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>CO Diversity In Tech (CODiv): Racism In Tech; The Industry March 14th, 2018 </h3>
            <h4>People Met, Things Learned</h4>
                <p>Dan (Event co-organizer with Elaine)- Approx around for 8 months, goals of the meet-up is to raise up young people through mentorship and create access to technology and tech literacy for all. This looks like workshops, job training/shadowing etc.</p>
                <p>Rebecca- MSU Human Resources student and trainer of Dogs. Stated teaching humans and dogs employed several similar practices. Also, clarified definition of a safe space as one where everyone is treated and respected equally, not one without dialogue or challenge. In fact, challenge is welcomed and cherished, but rudeness and disrespect are what isn't welcome. To paraphrase: it nullified the excuse that this is how things are in the "Real-World" and that actively continuing in such practices perpetuates the discrimination and the culpability of that is on that of the perpetrator of such statements.</p>
                <p>Speaker Karen Fleshman (founder Racey Conversations)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sand Creek Massacre was one of the worst in US history.</li>
                    <li>Much of our stereotyping, discrimination, etc. Comes from our Amygdala (lizard brain), the oldest section of it, and that cosequentially takes up the least mental energy, versus the pre-frontal cortex (judgement/ logic center) takes the most, so a common human behavior is to be reluctant to use it.</li>
                    <li>Redlining is a practice used by banks and lenders to prevent residents of whole geographic areas from having access to amenities that can help themselves better themselves. Often time goes hand in hand with gentrification. and locally was used to keep the 5 points neighborhood in poverty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just like the internet, many of these issues are interconnected. I need to be more sensitive and understanding the needs of others, not what I THINK their needs are. Also, in my conduct and in the conduct of others it would be good to take a step back and approach issues in a focused manner. To expand on that: don't get derailed by other common issues like sexism, ageism, classism; stress that the topic at hand is being discussed, but validate the other and make time for related topics after. Karen stating that activism and taking an assertive role as an ally is about practice, particularly like exercising a muscle. The more often it is used, the more ability and strength it will have. The profundity of it struck me like another layer of understanding being opened to me. It paired with the jump in attitude and practice/play that is encouraged so globally here at Galvanize, that it inspired me to work out that muscle more.</p>
                <p>I do believe, as stated earlier, that many of these issues are interconnected, and the image that comes to mind is untangling a really tight and difficult knot. It isn't easy and it does often take a while till any forward progress is made, but unlike the world, you can't just run down to the store and purchase a new society. This is ours to fix and those that want the evolution of our culture and species are going to have to carry a lot of weight as many still refuse, be it outright or through inaction. I really am excited for more involvement with Karen and CO Div in the future. I feel it is a place I can reach out and influence change in our world accelerating into the future, via the minds of those whom are to be the future work-force and leaders. It really is going to be the only way our race will be able to survive. Also, learning to self-care in the midst will help the long game nature of things. </p>
            <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When is it time to push the onus of particular behaviors that are racist to the perpetrator?</li>
                    <li>How can technology play a role in leveling the playing field in not only removing people's ideas of racial castes, but also call out corporate behaviors (like redlining and restriction of amenities) and not accept them anymore (ie punishing perpetrators severely as they have hurt others)?</li>
                    <li>Which tech companies are helping implement better practices and what practices have they adopted to see it happen?</li>
                </ul>
