                    <h3>Feb 28, 2018</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Goals:</h4> 
                    <p>finish #1, frame out #2, start 1 javascript exercise, practice a screen recording & outline script, Organize my linkedIn profile into compartments (outline?)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Specific: whiteboard the main on v-1 webpage to better conceptualize it. Survey and thoroughly model v-2 before starting, write script for screen recording to do. Review and whiteboard JS prob. Get inner tubes for bike.</p>
                    <p>Measurable: check in every 20-25 min for 5-10 min and record progress. If stuck on an issue for 15min jump to a new task like writing the script or JS exercises… Tabatta it!</p>
                    <p>Achievable: Same as yesterday. Maybe purposely forego a breakout that seems interesting. Set the tabatta alarm</p>
                    <p>Realistic: focus harder spend 75% of time in deep focused work </p>
                    <p>Timeline: whiteboard first and build a outline of my script. Review some css docs and vids. Work on V-1 for 20 min. Review v-2, Review JS. Work on V-1 20 min. Review script before lunch. Play on linked in at lunch </p>
                    <p>Good thoughts this morning. Was a little late due to bike tire flat. White boarding again and the tabatta timer for work came to me in my workout. I still have Teddy Roosevelt’s focus on my mind. I really want to lock into that myself and will be practicing it with some interval training again today. I know we went through this type of study in the L2L pre-course work. The term is ________ (look it up! ANSWER: POMODORO TECHNIQUE). Also, use the class model that Brooks showed us “red box” , “blue box” > .red, .blue, or .box</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>Gist: Most Goals met; Wins: Webpage #1 turned out great & Webpage #2 framed out; Fails: not setting interval practice time aside/ being intentional about setting timer; Tomorrow: be more mindful on time, how I spend it, and to maximize time spent focused on working and taking the needed breaks to keep my mind fresh.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Whew, a little sleepy still this morning. I did pretty well on my goals yesterday. I didn’t quite get them all done, so I think I a starting to accurately judge the duration it will take to accomplish my tasks. However, I aim to improve my efficiency so I like the idea of setting my day up where I nearly get everything done, and address all the items on my agenda. The warmup stumping me really left me feeling dumb and even looking at the answer, I have a hard time understanding the breakdown, as if I would need an instructor be able to break down how to solve the problem to even start. I finished and submitted v-1 Webpage after reading the rubric one last time. Then I built a quick element html outline for v-2 webpage, and whiteboarded it. I was brain-dead when I got to the javascript exercise so I just white-boarded on that problem figuring out what objects, arrays, functions and commands I would need to use. I was also able to outline a script I would use in learn to learn v-1 and the “stage-directions” for my screen recording. On the train home, I looked up how to post a blog or video on LinkedIn, as I could not find a way to do so from the phone app itself. I wasn’t able to organize a tabatta practice yet, so I think I will take an hour to do so today; I figure dedicating a portion of my day intentionally to doing just that will be a decently clear measure to see if it works for me.</p>

                <h3>March 6, 2018</h3>
                    <h4>Goals:</h4> 
                    <p>Setting 5 school goals for day: 1. resubmit website #2, 2. frame out website #3, 3. review web deployment, 4. find/schedule 2 meet ups, 5. JS questions/review of #1, start on #2, JS drills; <b>Extra:</b> Steve Austin Lightning talk out line (early life, wrestling, interesting facts(interactive exercises, t-shirt)); <b>NonSchool:</b> chicken shawarma, bike stuff, housing @ end of April, data entry jobs, plasma schedule, Growhaus email</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Begin working at resubmitting website #2 and review #3, Fix errors in JS exercise, study for a 20 min block and start #2, schedule 2 meet ups after lunch,frame out website #3 for 20 min, review deployment, finish with JS , submit goals at end of day</p>                   
                    <p>Measurable- be diligent about setting pomodoro timer</p>
                    <p>Achievable- don’t over-burden self, focus on goals first and if accomplished move on to other work</p>
                    <p>Realistic- again, don’t overburden with breakouts</p>
                    <p>Timely- take moments to review day schedule, and don’t make unnecessary trips</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>Man, today was rough, I felt overwhelmed most of the day and this bike thing isn’t helping at all… Let’s see, I can at least respond to the above, even not feeling like it. Website #2 success, website #3 pending fail: to do tonight, fix errors in JS exercise win! JS #2 fail, Meetups scheduled: fail. Review deployment: win + submitted 1 drill. I think I can spend at least 20 min tonight framing out my site and reviewing grid. Another thing to keep in mind is when I am for looping, <b>I don’t always need to use an if/conditional statement:</b> I can just say do this math and store it! That was kind of a breakthrough. Now the stress: I don’t feel like I can even articulate what is stressing me out. But I think tonight I need to write out what is bothering me so I can get it all on paper. I feel like a failure today cuz I feel stuck in JS. I feel the stress finances getting to me. I need a little help RN man, a little mercy. I feel like this monster isn’t going away, but I really want to succeed, and be able to afford a modest budget. I know I will be putting a bad review to the Bicycle Broker on the experience I had with them, specifically their reaction to my concerns esp. when addressing them politely. I will still be fair about their work, though, and transparent. I have a meeting with Brooks tomorrow, so I should start thinking of some good questions about why and how I feel overwhelmed. Also, try drill 2, just do it, submit it and fail if I must. I need to drag myself out of the funk. I should also congratulate myself for pushing forward even though I wanted to just shut down an hide all day. I feel, not like an imposter, but a little isolated, and the struggle is I know it's just stress getting to me, giving me that introspective paranoia, lol Sigh, I need to get my thoughts organized. I will wake up and push forward with tomorrow: A good night's sleep will hit that reset button nicely. One big thing I aim to do tomorrow is to prioritize my goals over other work or inspiration. Write the stuff down, but work towards the goals. If these emotions are continuing to bug, I am gonna choose to be positive, fake it till I make it, and I know I will pull myself to a better mental state. That will help me get to all my goals. I keep telling myself that I can do it, and will force myself to iterate how, so my intention is behind it!</p>

                <h3>March 14 2018</h3>
                    <h4>Goals:</h4> 
                    <p>Start DOM reading practice and breakout, Finish Website #3, Meetup #3 write-up, Resubmit JS #3 drill, L2L video, Lightning talk outline from notes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>Though I failed to meet most of my goals today felt pretty good. I was feeling a little bogged down, so I jumped into DOM stuff. I got a decent win there as I felt I got back up to speed with what I was learning in JSA, and that made me excited to finish up this first bucket to get to the second. I finished the write-up and notes on my lightning talk and began to white-board wire-framing it, but I ran out of energy. I did have some decent revelations in my practice yesterday:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Tackle small goals first and pepper them throughout the day to help keep working momentum going. They can help forward progress by switching to one before I become too bogged down in something.</li>
                        <li>Take breaks and use a Pomodoro timer! This has helped immensely as the timer acts as a challenge, just like in a AMRAP (As Many Rounds/Rep As Possible) & RFT (Rounds For Time) workout. The breaks allow me to get up and stretch and refocus. Take care of messages and get odds and ends taken care of so my work time is that much more focused. I find myself challenging me to complete a given task in X amount of cycles, trying to stay as few as possible.</li>
                        <li>set up contingencies for when I don't finish enough goals. I can hold off of Beer:30 (as I usually only drink 1 tops) in order to knock out a couple more easy tasks at the end of the day. I need after school for cooking, shopping and chores, so all the Meetups this week kinda has thrown me off, but I could have easily touched 3 goals minimum in a couple Pomodoro cycles if I so chose to yesterday. It would be the most effective use of my time and will give my brain a solid break from code, allowing it to rest and reformat for the next day. I feel more and more my groove is honing into something most effective with the goals and reflection. That and the Pomodoro timer will help immensely in life.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Wins & Losses:</h4> 
                    <p>I really dug into the DOM and got a good foot forward there. I was falling off in practice a little bit towards lunch so I should get better of identifying that and switching tasks to keep my focus optimal and fresh. I didn't touch website #3 or resubmit my JS drill (but will after this). I did however complete my write-up for my meetup and White-Boarded and parsed my notes for my lightning talk. Like I discussed above, starting with an easy win and peppering the lighter tasks throughout the day may keep my momentum higher along with my spirits. I am looking this weekend to try to find a few practices that I can implement to speed up my learning and retention of information. I believe it is a long process, so only changing a couple to few things at a time is the best way to measure whether or not a newly adopted practice is effective or not, and it also gives a whole week of time to explore the process to get a better idea if the process works for me, because everything feels awkward and ineffective at first, but through practice and exposure I will have a better idea if the process will be beneficial to adopt. These little goals definitely help break up the day and I really should consider being better about outlining larger tasks and breaking them into smaller ones in order to better structure my day and pomodoro timer. I am feeling like I am seeing a big chunk of puzzle coming together and that excites me. I will def be using the timer to keep my workload high at a disproportionately low stress level. Tomorrow I plan on utilizing the pomodoro timer from the get-go, when I arrive at school, to complete more in the earlier hours.</p>
